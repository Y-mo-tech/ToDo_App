In this project, we can register new user with email and password. A user will be able to create tasks, update tasks. Every user will have a wallet and it's balance will be initialised as zero after resgistering of user. A user will be able to login and add new task or update new task. Here use of jwt token and refresh token is also done so that user has an ease to update and add task if token is valid. Also on completion of every 3 new tasks, wallet balance will increase by 10 points. And if user will change password , wallet balance will decrease by 3 points.
